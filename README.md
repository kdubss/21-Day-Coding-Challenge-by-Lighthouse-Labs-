# 21 Day Coding Challenge - Ligthouse Labs - 2018 October
---
## About
The __21 Day Coding Challenge__ is a set of coding challenges hosted by *Lighthouse Labs* to encourage and challenge participants of all levels to get into an improve on their coding skills.

Daily challenges start on October first, and run throughout the subsequent 21 days until finished.
For each day, a new daily challenge is opened up for people to participate in (*assuming you have completed the previous day's challenge* - __if not__, then the next day's challenge will open *only when the previous day's challenge is completed*).

People are able to participate as individuals or as members of a team (*assuming that said team is an open team*).
I'm participang in a team of 3 called __Bro, do you even code?__.

The __21 DCC__ can be found [here](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/), and an online help forum can be found [here](https://21dayforum.lighthouselabs.ca/).  You'll have to sign up for both the challenge and the help forum.

<br />
The 21 DCC is a great way for people to get into and/or brush up on their ```JavaScript``` skills, and I'm taking this opportunity to learn and implement the __Mocha/Chai__ packages (testing framework / assertion library) to learn some TDD - Test Driven Development.
<br />
All daily challenges can be found in the ```challenges``` folder, while the specific functions for each day's challenge are found in the ```functions``` folder.
Mocha/Chai testing can be found in ```test.js``` within the ```test``` folder.

In order to run the tests, ```Mocha/Chai``` must be installed (i.e. ```npm i mocha chai```) to run ```test.js``` (```npm test```).
